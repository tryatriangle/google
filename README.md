Odin Project - re-create the google home page

Following the Odin Project's web dev 101 course, I had to try to recreate how the google home page looks. I couldn't get my profile picture in the top navigation bar to line up properly and I also couldn't understand why the footer is a few pixels indented on the left margin. Over all I'm satisfied with how it came out.
